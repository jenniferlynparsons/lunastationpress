                  <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">The on-going mission of Luna Station Quarterly is to display the vast and varied talents of women-identified speculative fiction writers.</p>

                  <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">This idea was conceived by founding editor, Jennifer Lyn Parsons, after she became aware of the apparent lack of support for the short story format within the literary community, and the particular lack of exposure of new women-identified writers in general within speculative fiction.</p>

                  <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">After tickling at Jennifer's brain for a few years, the time became right in 2010 for this concept to come to fruition, and the result is Luna Station Quarterly.</p>

                  <p>If you need a break from the season, and would in fact prefer aging druid veterinarians, adorable bee-cat hybrids, a vengeful weather forecaster who can control storms, nuclear faerie beetles, living nail art, an unemployed dragon rider and the usual cast of witches, selkies and the like, you've come to the right place.</p>

                  <p>Sneak this tome of wonders in your bag come holiday time, kids! It'll keep you busy during the interminably long hours of family strife. Or at the very least, it'll get you banned from the table. Either way, you'll thank us! See you next year!"</p>

                  <p class="mb-6">Our gorgeous cover is by Sve Yurchenko.</p>
