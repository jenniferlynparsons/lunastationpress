                  <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">The on-going mission of Luna Station Quarterly is to display the vast and varied talents of female speculative fiction writers.</p>

                  <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">This idea was conceived by founding editor, Jennifer Lyn Parsons, after she became aware of the apparent lack of support for the short story format within the literary community, and the particular lack of exposure of new female writers in general within speculative fiction.</p>

                  <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">After tickling at Jennifer's brain for a few years, the time became right for this concept to come to fruition, and the result is Luna Station Quarterly.</p>

Eight talented authors once again give you glimpses of worlds both familiar and alien, moving backwards and forwards in time and space, from Louisiana & Chicago, to a dusty settlement and abandoned house that bring new flavors to our tired notions of the apocalypse. The women and girls living these stories, like the authors that created them, are balancing old and new, grudges and hope, life and death. May we all learn from their journeys, their wisdom, and their folly.</p>

                  <p class="mb-6">Our gorgeous cover is by Lâle Ann.</p>
