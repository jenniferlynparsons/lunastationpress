<p>It was an honor and privilege for Luna Station to be invited to table at Time Warp Comics &amp; Games, as part of their celebration of Free Comic Book Day!</p>
<p>We were represented by our founder, Jennifer Parsons, author Cara Vescio, whose Wasteland series has been a perennial seller for us these last few years, and Erin DeMoss, whose cover illustration of Issue 21 of the Quarterly has been getting rave reviews.</p>
<p>We've been looking forward to getting out and talking to people about LSP / LSQ for a long time, and are grateful to Dave &amp; the Time Warp gang for giving us this opportunity.</p>
<p>Onward &amp; upwards!</p>
