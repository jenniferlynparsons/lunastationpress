<p>It's been a busy three weeks since the launch of the Luna Station 2.0.</p>
<p>Ayahuasca Nights &amp; David, A Rat have been met with such lovely support and goodwill, and while that has been happening, Jennifer and I have been working feverishly behind the scenes to prepare a chapbook of wonder &amp; mystery which we can honestly say is like nothing you've ever seen. We invite you into the world of sQualor // gLamour!</p>
<p>If this were the 90's, we'd call it a zine (though zines never had production values like this!) If this were the music industry, we would call it a single, released between albums. However you want to look at it, it's a bit of creative continuity connecting my last book, The Esbat Sequence, to the one I have been working on the last few years.</p>
<p>You can find out more about it here, and if you'd like, you can order one from Luna Station Direct.</p>
<p>We hope you have a wonderful holiday season!</p>
