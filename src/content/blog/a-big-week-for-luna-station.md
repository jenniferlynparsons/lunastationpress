<p>It's been a difficult few months, personally, here at The Station, but the show goes on. Life stuff does what it does, and sometimes that manifests as weird glitches in our publication schedule.</p>
<p>Normally, we wouldn't release two things in one week. (Well, that's not true. We did it back in October, and it was hell, and we swore we'd never do it again.) Yet, here we are, after yesterday's release of Issue 22 of the Quarterly (which was ridiculously successful - over 600 hits on the site in under 12 hours - THANK YOU ALL!) presenting something completely different … Invisible Compositions.</p>
<p>I've been told that the poems I write are "for people who normally don't read poetry". I'm not entirely sure what that means, but I've been assured it's a good thing.</p>
<p>What I can tell you is that my poems have magick in them (literally) and that if you read them, strange and wonderful things will careen around inside of you. At least that's the idea …</p>
<p>So, go read some poetry. Especially if you're not the type of person who normally would.</p>
