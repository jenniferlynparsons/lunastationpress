<p>After several months of behind the scenes work, here we are once again, for the third time (for the last time???) with two new books for you, which together show the breadth of what Luna Station has to offer.</p>
<p>Coming hot on the release of Issue 24 of The Quarterly (which had a successful launch last week) we are proud to present the final book in Cara Vescio’s popular Wasted Series, "Totally Wasted". Begun in 2012, this fourth book, the longest &amp; most action packed of the series, brings Cara’s tale of a dysfunctional family of contract killers to an epic conclusion, sure to please her many fans.</p>
<p>On the total other end of the spectrum, we are proud to present a remastered second edition of Dawn Baird’s "Enchantaka", a children’s story with a mid 20th century feel, full of shadows and light, magic boxes and fairies. Join us in welcoming Dawn back to the Luna Station family!</p>
<p>We have an ambitious schedule of releases planned for 2016, including print omnibuses of the early issues of The Quarterly (previously only available as eBooks) so be sure to keep up with us on Twitter, Facebook &amp; Tumblr for the latest.</p>
<p>Have a marvelous holiday season, whichever your persuasion, and thank you as always for your support!</p>
