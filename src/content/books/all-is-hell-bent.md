This collection of stories and poems features the tragic tale of Loki and his wife Sigyn, brought to life in this exploration of love, trust, and devotion. 

What would make a goddess, raised to be an honored member of Odin’s court, defy the clean and safe path laid out for her, in favor of the love of a Trickster?

What would make her stay when Ragnarok looms and all is hell bent?
