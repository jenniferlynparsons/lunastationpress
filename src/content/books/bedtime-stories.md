These five line poems, inspired by, but not beholden to, Japanese tanka, are prayerseeds for the people of the future. Like Rilke’s Book of Hours or Sonnets to Orpheus, (or possibly a rogue patch in Stevenson’s Garden) they are an imaginary hymnal, by turns deeply personal and wholly universal.

Written over the course of a year and a day, they are yet another variety of the spell cast in The Esbat Sequence, sQualor // gLamour & Invisible Compositions. Leave this book on your nightstand, read one each night before you go to bed, then write down your dreams in the morning. In this way, you will write the next hymnal.

And what of the insouciant alchemists? Who were they? Did they know Amelia, Icarus!, Dunmore & the rest?

The answer may surprise you …
