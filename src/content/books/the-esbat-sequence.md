With The Esbat Sequence, Tara Lindsey has traveled into the mist, bringing back half remembered memories and possible futures. A post-digital seanchaí, finding her voice in a constantly evolving world, she has tapped into something old, and simultaneously very, very new.

Written mostly during the threshold hours before dawn, these non-linear Trickster tales, of Fire and ash and rebirth, of masks and lighthouses and “a fox who has secret knowledge of interstitial spaces”, are an invitation, to a world of stories and songs and things you can touch, and to more subtle, hidden things as well.

The Esbat Sequence is a spell, a seed, planted deep in space and time, part of an unfolding cross-dimensional hyper narrative. It’s also as simple to read as a fairy tale, and occasionally twice as dangerous. It will fill your head with ideas. It will change you, if you let it.

You have been warned.
