A connective thread between what has come before and what is yet to come, sQualor // gLamour is an important chapter in Tara’s unfolding, non-linear poetic hyper-narrative. Which is to say it’s kind of batshit, chock full of as many of her passions / obsessions as could fit in twenty four fully illustrated, full color pages. You probably won’t understand this book. Read it anyway. Your future self will thank you.
