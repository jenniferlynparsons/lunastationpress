Elizabeth Hinckley is a teller of stories, hiding in plain sight as a neighbor, co-worker, student, and secret adventurer. She has spent several years researching the areas between NY’s Hudson Valley and Philadelphia, and many more studying how to listen with love to the secrets of things living, and those who used to be. She lives in NJ with her family, including beloved animal members, of course. This is her first novel.
