Tara Quinn Lindsey has promethean ambitions. After a lifetime spent toiling away in the music business (she started drumming at age six and performing at thirteen) not to mention over twenty years exploring the hidden pathways of the Western Mystery Tradition, she is now turning her attention, energy and charm towards the publishing industry.

A poet by vocation, aspiring towards the visionary lineage of Blake, Whitman, Dickinson, Ginsberg and Merwin, Tara is excited by the opportunities afforded to dedicated, creative writers at this crucial time in the history of books and reading.
